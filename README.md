""Binaural Audio Generator with Tkinter""

This project allows you to generate binaural audio tones using Python. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter, enabling you to customize audio parameters such as frequency, duration, sample rate, and volume.

âœ¨ Key Features

Generate binaural beats by specifying separate left and right ear frequencies.

Modify duration, sample rate, and volume for tailored experiences.

Display recommended parameter values for guidance.

Play and stop the audio with simple controls.

ðŸŽ§ Frequency Ranges for Brainwave States

Utilize the tool to explore different brainwave states by configuring frequencies as follows:

Delta Waves (0.5 - 4 Hz):

Promotes deep sleep and relaxation.

Example: Left Frequency = 100 Hz, Right Frequency = 103 Hz.

Theta Waves (4 - 8 Hz):

Ideal for meditation, intuition, and creativity.

Example: Left Frequency = 200 Hz, Right Frequency = 204 Hz.

Alpha Waves (8 - 14 Hz):

Enhances relaxation and focused calmness.

Example: Left Frequency = 300 Hz, Right Frequency = 308 Hz.

Beta Waves (14 - 30 Hz):

Boosts concentration, alertness, and problem-solving.

Example: Left Frequency = 400 Hz, Right Frequency = 414 Hz.

Gamma Waves (30 - 100 Hz):

Supports peak focus, learning, and cognitive function.

Example: Left Frequency = 500 Hz, Right Frequency = 530 Hz.

ðŸ›  Recommended Parameter Values

Here are some starting values to help you get the best results:

Left Frequency (Hz): 400 (default starting point).

Right Frequency (Hz): Offset by a small amount (e.g., 410 Hz).

Duration (seconds): 5-10 seconds for testing; increase for extended sessions.

Sample Rate (Hz): 44100 Hz (standard CD quality).

Volume: 0.5 (mid-level volume).

ðŸš€ How to Use

Run the Python script to launch the application.

Adjust the parameters in the GUI:

Enter left and right channel frequencies.

Specify the duration, sample rate, and volume.

Refer to recommended values shown next to each field for guidance.

Click Play Sound to generate and play the audio.

Use Stop Sound to end playback anytime.

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

This application requires the following Python libraries:

numpy

sounddevice

tkinter (pre-installed with Python)

Install missing dependencies using:

pip install numpy sounddevice

ðŸ”” Notes

For the best experience, use stereo headphones to properly hear the binaural beats.

Experiment with different frequency ranges to explore their effects on relaxation, focus, and creativity.

Ensure your system's audio settings are correctly configured for stereo output.
