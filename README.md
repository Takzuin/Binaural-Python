Its a funny repository, im not musician btw.
But this are the things u cant change and make diferent sounds
sample_rate: This is like the quality, its like the principal thing who can change the sound.(ChatGPT Give me a 44.000hZ y try with 150.000 and sounds lot better)
volume: regular in 0.5(Just Volume i think)

In the binaural sounds the thing is that the both chanels have a little diferece btw the both sides. 

freq_left: Frequency
freq_right: Frequency

duration: 10 like 10 seconds, more time more time before listen.
